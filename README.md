# Contact List App

Simple app built with React + Redux + AntD

## How to deploy

1. clone repo
2. npm i
3. npm run serve

## Username and password

Note that user authentication in this app is mocked with simple json-server and has nothing with real world auth concepts. Seriously, don't do like that :)

You can find availible users credentials in db.json file. However you can add new one by yourself
